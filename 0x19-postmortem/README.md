# Project 0x19-Postmortem

This is an incident report based on the Holberton School project [Web stack debugging #1](https://github.com/ammartica/holberton-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x0E-web_stack_debugging_1)

## Issue Summary:
We just installed Nginx as our web server but we are unable to connect to port 80. This is a potential problem for our customers because if they try to access our website using unencrypted hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP), they will be unable to do so.

## Timeline:
 * When was the issue detected: 2022-04-25 00:00 (GMT-04:00)
 * How was the issue detected: During a routine test
 * Actions taken: Researched default installation files for enabled and available sites
 * Which team/individuals was the incident escalated to: Amisaday Mart√≠nez Campos
 * How the incident was resolved: Changing the default file for enabled sites so it would listen to port 80 instead of port 8080

## Root cause and resolution
Because we noticed this issue right after we had installed the Nginx web server, we figured Nginx closes port 80 by default. We decided to look into the default files that come with Nginx. and noticed
this was indeed where the issue was. The default file for enabled sites was listening in on port 8080 instead of port 80. 
<br />
To fix this issue, we removed that file and created a symbolic link to the default file for available sites,
which was identical except that it was listening in on port 80, which was what we wanted.
<br />
To confirm our solution worked, we restarted the server to apply the changes and ran the curl command to connect through port 80 and it worked.

## Corrective and preventative measures:
To avoid similar problems in the future, we should devise a protocol to always verify the default files of our web server are in accordance to the specifications we determine as important.
